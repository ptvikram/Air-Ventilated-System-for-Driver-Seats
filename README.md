# Air-Ventilated-System-for-Driver-Seats
Design of a mechanism for proper circulation of air between the back of bus driver &amp; front of the backrest of the driver seat.  

## ABSTRACT  

This paper deals with the investigation of the performance of car seat fabrics in terms of physiological comfort of sitting, specifically their sweat-drenched on the back after long driving and air permeability. The current work presents an alternative approach to increasing the effectiveness of car seat fabrics through a combination of nearly designed arrangements between the front of the seat and the driver’s back. The supplementary device was designed to supply air circulation at the back portion of the body by employing sweating to stop and not distract the driver focus from driving.  

 It consists of two components: A-frame to support the resting area of the back part of the body. Which helps to maintain back body posture while driving. And another component will supply air from the cabin to the required area of the body part. This will result to provide a proper air supply which avoids the cause of sweating. The outcomes of the study have several important implications for future practice. The combination of a car seat with our proposed device with channeled structure and continuous flow of air improves physiological comfort of seating which is a key issue for drivers.   
 
 The proposed device for continuous air flow through convection in the plane of car seat fabric has not yet been part of an actual car seat however it was previously built for the smart car which is not affordable for a middle-classed person whereas our device is cheaper and easy to use also there is no need of any installation or implantation in the seat we just need to keep in between the backrest of seat and the trunk part of the body. It works on the principles of Smart Ventilated Seats.   
 
 
Keywords: Physiological comfort, Channelled fabric structure with compact design, Air supply, Proposed ventilation device with seat arrangement.   

## INTRODUCTION  
“We perform a survey of a few corporative societies where we find the problem for Drivers and passengers as we saw their Every driver is facing one common problem which is a skin infection in the trunk part of the body due to improper seating on the driver seat”.     
 
All automobile vehicle drivers have to drive for a long period and continuously due to which there is insufficient air circulation at the contact surface of the back of the body part and backrest of the seat. This results in continuous sweating and  inflammation which leads to a skin infection.  

### Causes of distraction to the driver  
As we discussed before, the problem is for driver’s seat which is the most important subject when we talk about any road transportation. Driver comfort is very important because the number one cause of car accidents is “Distracted Driver”.  
Future mobility trends such as the automotive industry, connectivity, or electromobility are setting new focuses in the automotive industry. The transfer of the driving function to the vehicle will lead to variable seating arrangements, which leads to a new vehicle interior, the aspects of comfort, ergonomics, and air–conditioning system is the largest secondary energy consumer, and especially in electric vehicles, the driving range can be significantly reduced by heating and cooling. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the energy efficiency of air-conditioning systems by improving and developing a new concept. The challenge is to enable individual air- conditioning for each occupant in all possible sitting positions as shown in fig.2.3. Due to longer driving times and the focus on non-driving related tasks, the customer’s demand for thermal comfort will thus become increasingly important.  
In this context, the vehicle seat represents the contact surface of the driver to seat with comfort also surface between passengers. Especially during the summer months, the thermal comfort of the vehicle interior plays a vital role. This investigation aims to develop an innovative ventilated arrangement with a seat based on a conventional driver’s seat, which provides optimized thermal comfort close to the body. The main research question is:  
Can the seat play a dominant role to provide thermal comfort?   

### Air Ventilation System in Driver Seat  
Presently there are some products/mechanisms in use. But they are not that effective, and the products which are fulfilling the requirement of drivers are very costly, and a limited income customer can’t afford to buy.  


As we know automobile industry has grown so much for providing comfort (i.e. AC, Posture comfort seats). But still, there are some problems such as   
1) Sweat drenched on back after long driving  
2) Dull air in car and fatigue driving  
3) Outdoor parking, the seat exposure to hot  

So, after observing this problem we are trying to propose a system arrangement that will provide the proper air circulation at the front of the backrest of the seat, so the above problems shown in fig.3.1 can be minimized or limited up to a certain extinct. The proposed system will work in such a way that it will limit the problem caused by sweating. We are providing a path for the air to reach up to the back part of the driver’s body. We designed the backrest for better posture comfort and in that backrest component, there will be outlets for air to create a good air-vented environment in the trunk area of the driver.  
This paper with an outlet concept that generates an air supply to the backrest portion of the body which will give physiological comfort to the driver and passengers. Furthermore, the seat with the proposed device will be verified to evaluate better posture to the back of the body.  


## CONCLUSION  
The objective of this paper was to give better comfort to the driver when compared with smart car seats with a high range of cost. To provide a pure supply of ventilation system at a back-rest portion of the person body with better posture to be maintained while sitting and driving of back truck part of the body of driver and passenger whom will use our proposed design device. It takes less maintenance and is not much costly to purchase. Everyone can use it while setting and it is adjustable at the body weight of every person who is below overweight. The material trial used in the proposed design is having good strength and flexibility which gives an excellent performance of the device and comfort to driver and passenger.
