# Air-Ventilated-System-for-Driver-Seats
Design of a mechanism for proper circulation of air between the back of bus driver &amp; front of the backrest of the driver seat.  
ABSTRACT  

This paper deals with the investigation of the performance of car seat fabrics in terms of physiological comfort of sitting, specifically their sweat-drenched on the back after long driving and air permeability. The current work presents an alternative approach to increasing the effectiveness of car seat fabrics through a combination of nearly designed arrangements between the front of the seat and the driverâ€™s back. The supplementary device was designed to supply air circulation at the back portion of the body by employing sweating to stop and not distract the driver focus from driving.
